Though they occasionally represented complex themes as seen in Jacques Tourneur’s <em>I Walked with a </em>Zombie (1943), they were also historically objects of fear in voodoo-inflected radio and movie thrillers mostly notable now for their extraordinary racism. The zombie would be reinvented in 1968 in George Romero’s <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> as a vehicle for critiquing issues like race relations in the United States and the ongoing military engagement in Vietnam. But what is the current state of the zombie narrative? From <em>The Walking Dead</em> comic series to the subsequent television adaption to films like<em>Zombieland</em> (2009) and <em>World War Z</em> (2013), the zombie frequently appears to be an excuse to brutally kill “the other.” While it is true that non-American productions like the television series <em>In the Flesh</em> (2013) and <em>The Returned</em> (2012) consider nuanced complications associated with people rising from the dead, the more successful offerings focus heavily on certain destructive aspects of the human psyche. Often, the zombie reflects our monstrous capacity. True, theorists from René Descartes to Jacques Lacan to Michel Foucault to Giorgio Agamben provide tools for unpacking this trend in popular culture. Yet, such tools can be difficult to deploy in an undergraduate classroom, especially in a Science Fiction course that tends to attract students from a broad spectrum of academic disciplines. In this paper, I will demonstrate how Daryl Gregory’s <em>Raising Stony Mayhall</em>addresses the complexities of both the zombie and the society that encounters them. I will analyze how Gregory covers this troubled terrain by inverting the prevailing assumptions about and cultural engagements with “the undead” in his anti-zombie zombie novel by focusing primarily on a very human post-human in a way that students find informative, accessible, and relatable<br />\n<br />\n<em>The Personal and the Apocalyptic in James Tiptree Jr.'s Short Fiction</em><br />\nThe tension between the individual and the collective seems to be ironically immanent in most science fiction, especially when its themes claim to stand for humanity as a collective by focusing on individual motivation and agency. This finds its fullest expression in the short fiction of James Tiptree Jr. Tiptree’s abiding theme in science fiction, in hindsight, seems to have been death, but could often interpreted within the thematic context of her work as a synonym for life. She translated death within a science fictional context into the larger theme of the apocalypse, but her protagonists are often selfish in their actions and the nature of their agency, thus subverting the trope of the paradigm shift that occurs in most science fiction in both shorter and longer forms. My paper seeks to analyze this very tension existing between the personal and the apocalyptic in four of Tiptree’s short stories: ‘The Last Flight of Doctor Ain’, ‘The Screwfly Solution’, ‘The Man Who Walked Home’ and ‘Her Smoke Rose Up Forever’, and the pressure it exerts on the narratives. In doing so, I will also try to examine whether something approaching a uniquely science fictional mode of storytelling emerges in the process.</div>\n","format":"Academic","datetime":"2016-08-19T12:00:00-05:00","date":"2016-08-19","day":"Friday","time":"12:00","mins":"60","loc":["2201 (Academic)","Kansas City Convention Center"],"tags":["Academic"],"people":[{"id":"2641","name":"Robert Lipscomb","role":"Participant"},{"id":"2642","name":"Arnab Chakraborty","role":"Participant"}]},{"id":"905","title":"Reading: Julia Mandala","themes":[],"desc":"","format":"Reading","datetime":"2016-08-19T12:00:00-05:00","date":"2016-08-19","day":"Friday","time":"12:00","mins":"30","loc":["2202 (Readings)","Kansas City Convention Center"],"tags":[],"people":[{"id":"1518","name":"Julia Mandala","role":"Participant"}]},{"id":"441","title":"Spec Fic Poets: A Group Reading","themes":[],"desc":"Eight speculative fiction poets come together in this fun and engaging reading as they perform their work in their own unique styles.","format":"Group Reading","datetime":"2016-08-19T12:00:00-05:00","date":"2016-08-19","day":"Friday","time":"12:00","mins":"60","loc":["2203 (Readings)","Kansas City Convention Center"],"tags":["Literature"],"people":[{"id":"2384","name":"Frederick Turner","role":"Participant"},{"id":"2621","name":"Michael Substelny","role":"Participant"},{"id":"462","name":"Mr. Robin Wayne Bailey","role":"Participant"},{"id":"1400","name":"Mary Soon Lee","role":"Participant"},{"id":"2518","name":"Jim Davidson","role":"Participant"},{"id":"2563","name":"Symantha Reagor","role":"Moderator"},{"id":"2501","name":"Bogi Takács","role":"Participant"},{"id":"2372","name":"Erin Wilcox","role":"Participant"}]},{"id":"499","title":"Magazine Group Reading: Analog","themes":[],"desc":"Our Magazine Group Reading Series continues with a special group reading that features authors from <em>Analog</em>.","format":"Group Reading","datetime":"2016-08-19T12:00:00-05:00","date":"2016-08-19","day":"Friday","time":"12:00","mins":"60","loc":["2204","Kansas City Convention Center"],"tags":["Reading","Group Reading","Literature"],"people":[{"id":"1823","name":"Trevor Quachri","role":"Moderator"},{"id":"2184","name":"James Van Pelt","role":"Participant"},{"id":"2323","name":"Alvaro Zinos-Amaro","role":"Participant"},{"id":"1939","name":"Stanley Schmidt","role":"Participant"},{"id":"1692","name":"Alec Nevala-Lee","role":"Participant"}]},{"id":"55","title":"History of the Book","themes":[],"desc":"From Cuneiform tablets to papyrus and parchment to paper, from the scroll to the codex to the hand-written and hand-bound book, to the Gutenberg Press and the e-book.

We will look at two major aspects of this topic: dealing with technological and scientific advancements that have implications for posthumanist philosophy, and studying recent changes in dystopias as seen through contemporary attitudes toward social inequalities.<br />\nIsaac Bell will focus on the posthumanist/transhumanist implications of medical advancements, human modification, and the rise of artificial intelligences.  Amanda Hemmingsen will look at how dystopic settings and structures in many science fiction works shape, reflect, and respond to social inequalities. We hope to spur a discussion that will improve our ability to educate audiences about these questions through the vehicle of imaginative storytelling.","format":"Academic","datetime":"2016-08-21T15:00:00-05:00","date":"2016-08-21","day":"Sunday","time":"15:00","mins":"50","loc":["2201 (Academic)","Kansas City Convention Center"],"tags":["Academic"],"people":[{"id":"2639","name":"Isaac Bell","role":"Participant"},{"id":"2638","name":"Amanda Hemmingsen","role":"Participant"},{"id":"2768","name":"Kristen Koopman","role":"Moderator"}]},{"id":"950","title":"Reading: Rachael Acks","themes":[],"desc":"","format":"Reading","datetime":"2016-08-21T15:00:00-05:00","date":"2016-08-21","day":"Sunday","time":"15:00","mins":"30","loc":["2202 (Readings)","Kansas City Convention Center"],"tags":[],"people":[{"id":"408","name":"Mx Rachael Acks","role":"Participant"}]},{"id":"818","title":"Reading: Esther Friesner","themes":[],"desc":"","format":"Reading","datetime":"2016-08-21T15:00:00-05:00","date":"2016-08-21","day":"Sunday","time":"15:00","mins":"60","loc":["2203 (Readings)","Kansas City Convention Center"],"tags":[],"people":[{"id":"80","name":"Esther Friesner","role":"Participant"}]},{"id":"544","title":"Shared World Anthology - Last Cities of Earth","themes":[],"desc":"Jeff Sturgeon and friends present work derived from the 'Last Cities on Earth' shared world: <br />\nIn 2085 scientists announce that the super volcano Yellowstone will erupt in 2091.
