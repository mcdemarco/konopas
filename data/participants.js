In the ninth grade I concluded I’d earn my living as a scriptwriter or behind the scenes TV journalist.  Reading Isaac Azimov on science led to my discovery of SF magazines and books and the existence of fandom.  By college I’d largely dropped fiction focusing on journalism beginning with a stint as a DJ and journalist for the school’s NPR station WHRW and offers to write music reviews for fledgling magazines before a stint writing for AP Sports before deciding on graduate school for an MA in Communications.  My thesis, “The Difference Between NASA’s and SF Writers’ Views of the Future of Space Exploration led to an internship covering science for the Baltimore Sun, which in turn led to freelancing as a reporter for area papers and regularly writing science book reviews for the Sun before turning to a steadier income source.  More than 20 years as a tech writer and editor and immersion into fandom followed.  With my recent retirement, I’ve now come full circle.  I’m again paying attention to TV, movies and even radio and writing stories with an eye to eventual publication.\r\n\r\nElaine Stiles\r\n","prog":["19","230","256","264"]},{"id":"2067","name":["Steve","Stiles","Mr.",""],"bio":"Steve entered into science fiction through E.C. comics,which published Ray Bradbury stories, going to his first convention, Lunacon, in 1959.
